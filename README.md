======================

Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This project contains a single R script (run_analysis.R) that creates both the merged dataset (merge.txt) and tidy dataset (tidy.txt) in the "data" directory (which will be created for you if it doesn't previously exist).  The script itself contains a single function called "run" that is set to automatically execute once the file is executed (either from the command-line or from R-Studio).  Details on the contents of the merged and tidy datasets is provided in CodeBook.md.
